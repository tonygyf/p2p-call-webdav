# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands
- `npm install` - Install dependencies
- `npm start` - Launch production build
- `npm run dev` - Launch development mode
- `npm run build` - Package application

## Code Architecture
Electron-based P2P chat application using:
- WebDAV client (`webdav` package) for encrypted storage
- SQLite3 for local message database
- AES-256-CBC encryption (see `config.js`)
- Main process manages WebDAV sync and encryption
- Client UI handles real-time communication

Configuration follows `config.js` structure with:
- `webdav` credentials
- `encryption` parameters
- `app` settings
- `paths` for database location
